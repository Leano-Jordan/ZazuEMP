# ZAZU EMP — COMMERCIAL READINESS REGISTER

## Purpose

This is the live release-risk register.

Readiness is tracked by domain and evidence maturity rather than by a single inflated percentage.

## Evidence maturity

0 — not started  
1 — designed  
2 — implemented  
3 — automated evidence  
4 — runtime/CI verified  
5 — repeatedly proven through realistic/production/recovery evidence

## Release domains

- **Correctness** — critical workflows produce the intended result.
- **Architecture** — core structure is understandable, bounded and maintainable.
- **Data Integrity** — transactions, parent/child invariants, ownership, precision and concurrency are protected.
- **Security** — authentication, authorization, isolation, storage and trust boundaries are enforced.
- **Workflow Integrity** — real jobs can move through valid states, including failure/recovery.
- **UX / Accessibility** — critical flows are understandable and usable across required devices/themes.
- **Reliability / Recovery** — failures are observable and data can be restored.
- **Operability** — the owner can diagnose incidents and understand application health.
- **Deployment / Upgrade Safety** — clean and representative existing installations can be upgraded safely.
- **Documentation / Ownership / Compliance** — release/runbook, dependency, IP and privacy evidence exists.
- **Release Evidence** — claims are based on current CI/runtime/browser evidence.

## What blocks commercial release

A release-critical blocker can cause:
- data loss or corruption;
- unauthorized access;
- broken critical workflow;
- unrecoverable upgrade/deployment;
- inability to restore;
- materially incorrect financial/commercial state;
- inability to operate or diagnose the product.

## Future-scale work

Not automatic V1 blockers unless explicitly required:
- SaaS billing/entitlements;
- high-scale performance proof;
- multi-location expansion;
- production soak evidence;
- advanced messaging/portal ecosystem;
- advanced AI automation.

Future architecture should remain compatible with these possibilities without allowing them to displace current release-risk work.

## Current directive

**Close existing correctness, architecture, integrity, security, reliability and release-evidence gaps before speculative feature expansion.**
