# Zazu EMP — V1 Software / Commercial Status

**Assessment date:** 2026-10-01  
**Repository:** `Leano-Jordan/ZazuEMP`  
**Application assessment HEAD:** `52d9b26bc17ddee8d1427032ecaf2fb8fc0b6350`

## Current position

Zazu EMP has a substantial connected operational foundation across:
- authentication/business context;
- customers and jobs;
- requirements/capabilities;
- quotes and revisions;
- travel and operational costs;
- preparation;
- finance;
- purchasing;
- inventory;
- physical assets;
- reporting;
- responsive/shared UI.

The product is **not yet release-certified**. The current application assessment has green automated CI/browser/static-quality evidence, but several commercial-operational proof gates remain open.

## Release-critical work remaining

### Commercial completion
- Customer-facing quote delivery/presentation
- Quote acceptance/deposit lifecycle
- Complete invoice/document workflow
- Payment/reconciliation completion

### Integrity and control
- Complete authorization coverage
- Complete audit/activity continuity
- Parent/child and concurrency verification across critical mutations
- Representative existing-database migration/upgrade verification

### Recovery and operations
- Real backup/restore drill
- Restore of representative data and private media
- Rollback procedure
- Operational diagnostics/observability
- Final deployment/configuration review

### Current release evidence

- Laravel: **202 passed / 1,174 assertions**
- Browser: **7 passed / 8 skipped**; the complete registration journey runs once on Chromium to avoid shared-IP registration throttling, while responsive entry coverage is separate
- Zazu Quality: **passed**
- PHPMD: **passed**
- Psalm: **passed** after removing the redundant init step and applying a narrowly scoped Laravel 13.34.0 compatibility shim for one unsupported `@phpstan-this-out` annotation
- Fresh SQLite migration, Blade compilation, asset build/manifest verification and application configuration validation: **passed**

### Runtime proof
- Browser critical-path traversal
- Desktop/mobile verification
- Light/dark verification
- Accessibility verification
- Real local database/browser verification where CI cannot prove the owner's environment

## Engineering-system status

The repository now has a state-driven AI engineering control system:

- Morpheus/Jarvis control plane
- Discovery & Design
- Builder
- Guardian with Forensics / Break / Security / Data Integrity modes
- Release
- UI/UX Improvement
- persistent STATE / DECISION / REGRESSION / READINESS ledgers
- anti-loop and context-firewall controls

This documentation refactor is **engineering-control work**, not application feature completion.

## Evidence language

IMPLEMENTED, TESTED, VERIFIED and PROVEN are intentionally different states.

Historical CI/test figures in older records remain historical and are not restated as current evidence unless a current run is observed.

## Direction

The next Zazu engineering effort should close the highest-risk remaining release gate: populated commercial workflow → real recovery → representative upgrade → rollback → final Director certification.
